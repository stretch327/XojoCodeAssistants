# XojoCodeAssistants
A set of Code Assistant scripts for people who do a lot of declare work.

## Summary

Over the last few months, I've been doing a lot of declare work for users and gathering and making scripts to make that process easier. 

## Usage

I find the easiest place to put scripts these days is in the Xojo folder in your user directory. That directory can be found on macOS at:

`/Users/Your Name/Documents/Xojo/IDE/Scripts/`

or similar location on the other platforms. The easiest way to find it is to use Xojo to find:

`SpecialFolder.Documents`

and then look in (or create) Xojo, IDE and Scripts folders.
